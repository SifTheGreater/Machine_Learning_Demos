# Machine_Learning_Demos

This repo contains some Demo implementations of many common Machine Learning models.

In each of the seperate folders I go over many algorithms, what follows is an index of these algorithms.

- Assosiation Rule Learning
  - Apriori Rule Model
  - Eclat Rule Model
- Classification
  - Logistic Regression Classification
  - K Nearest Neighbours
  - Suport vector Machine
  - Naive bayes Algorithm
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Clasifier
  - XGboosing classifier
  - Selection Template for all models
- Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - K Means Clustering
- Data Preprocessing Template
  - Useful file for basic preprocessing
- Deep Learning
  - Artifical Nueral Network
  - Conveluted Nueral Network
- Natural Language Processing
  - Bag of Words Model
- Regression
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Linear Regression
  - Support Vector Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Selection Template for these Models
- Reinforcemnet Learning
  - Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm
  - Thompson Sampling Algorithm
- Model Selection + Tuning
  - k fold cross validation
  - grid search tuning

I will Continue adding to these algorithms as I learn and implement more.
